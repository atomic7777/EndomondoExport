# Endomondo Export

Endomondo GPX TCX activity exporter / downloader

If you use [Endomondo](http://www.endomondo.com) great service to track your workouts you'll soon realize of a very (IMHO) disappointing feature (or lack of): the ability to export all your information at once. Unfortunately, even though this a request highly demanded by Endomondo's users, they have no plans to implement it, as stated here:

_Hi guys, there is unfortunately no way how to export/import (from the file) more than one workout at once and we do not plan to implement it._

There are several options around to be able to do this (sort of) including 3rd party apps and scripts, but I found myself in the need of creating something so it's slightly easier to use for everyone. I've built this very simple Windows forms application that does this, and I'm also providing the code for everyone to peek at it and do whatever they want (maybe port it to a Linux app?).

I initially built it for myself, looking at some other places around to try to get some information, and looking into Fiddler to see what was going on, and I thought maybe someone else could find it useful, so you're absolutely free to download it, and do whatever you want to do with the code if you wish, which BTW is provided as-is. ;-)

Please read the migrated docs for more information until I have time to arrange the README.md file. :-)

You can download the compiled binaries here in the meantime:
